════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SEQUENCE DESIGN PROCESS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Based on the business website data provided, select the TWO most relevant sequence types and design them completely.

Choose from:
- Onboarding (5-7 emails over 14-21 days)
- Re-engagement (3-4 emails over 10-14 days)
- Win-back (3-5 emails over 30 days)
- Product Launch (4-6 emails over 2-3 weeks)
- Event Follow-up (3-4 emails over 7-10 days)
- Upgrade/Upsell (3-5 emails over 2-3 weeks)
- Educational Drip (5-8 emails over 4-6 weeks)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SEQUENCE TEMPLATES (use as starting framework)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ONBOARDING: Welcome → Quick Win → Core Feature → Advanced Feature → Social Proof → Check-in → Upgrade Prompt
RE-ENGAGEMENT: "We miss you" → Value Reminder → Incentive Offer → Last Chance
WIN-BACK: Check-in → What's New → Special Offer → Feedback Request → Final Goodbye
PRODUCT LAUNCH: Teaser → Launch Announcement → Feature Spotlight → Social Proof → Limited Offer → Last Chance
EVENT FOLLOW-UP: Thank You → Resource Roundup → Related Offer → Feedback Survey
UPGRADE/UPSELL: Usage Milestone → Feature Gap → Upgrade Benefits → Limited Incentive → Plan Comparison
EDUCATIONAL DRIP: Intro → Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 → Lesson 3 → Application → Resources → Graduation

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FOR EACH EMAIL PRODUCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Subject Line — 2-3 options per email. Vary: curiosity / benefit-driven / urgency / personalisation / question. Keep under 50 characters where possible.
2. Preview Text — 40-90 characters that complement (do NOT repeat) the subject line.
3. Email Purpose — one sentence: why this email exists and what it moves the recipient toward.
4. Body Copy — full draft ready to use. Hook → Body → CTA. Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max). Bold key phrases. Personalisation tokens where relevant ({{first_name}}, {{company_name}}).
5. Primary CTA — button text and destination URL.
6. Timing — days after trigger or previous email.
7. Segment/Condition Notes — who receives this vs. who skips it.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SEQUENCE LOGIC (define for each sequence)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Branching conditions: alternate paths based on engagement (opened but did not click, clicked CTA, ignored)
- Exit conditions: what action means the recipient has converted and should leave the sequence
- Re-entry rules: can someone re-enter? Under what conditions?
- Suppression rules: do not send if in another active sequence, unsubscribed, or contacted support in last 48h

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS BY TYPE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Onboarding:     Open 35-45% | CTR 8-12%  | Conversion 10-15% | Unsub <0.2%
Re-engagement:  Open 15-25% | CTR 2-5%   | Conversion 3-8%   | Unsub 1-2%
Win-back:       Open 15-20% | CTR 2-4%   | Conversion 1-3%   | Unsub 1-3%
Product Launch: Open 30-50% | CTR 5-15%  | Conversion 5-15%  | Unsub <0.5%
Upsell:         Open 25-40% | CTR 5-12%  | Conversion 8-20%  | Unsub <0.5%

Adjust benchmarks based on the business's industry if context is provided.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
A/B TEST SUGGESTIONS (include 2-3)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Recommend tests from: subject line curiosity vs. benefit-driven, CTA button text, email send time, plain text vs. HTML, long vs. short email body, personalisation in subject line.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING RUBRIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Score the business's email marketing readiness from 0–100:

90–100: Email-native — Strong capture, clear sequences, conversion-optimised copy
75–89:  Ready — Good foundation, sequences would significantly lift conversion
60–74:  Basic — Email capture present but no visible nurture strategy
45–59:  Minimal — Limited email signals detected on the website
0–44:   None — No email capture or marketing signals found

Category weights (each scored 0–100):
- Email Capture Presence:  30%
- Lead Magnet Quality:     25%
- Content for Nurture:     25%
- Conversion Path Clarity: 20%

Score = round((emailCapture × 0.30) + (leadMagnet × 0.25) + (contentForNurture × 0.25) + (conversionPath × 0.20))

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT RULES — READ CAREFULLY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH { AND END WITH }
2. DO NOT use markdown code fences (no \`\`\`json or \`\`\`).
3. DO NOT add any text before the opening { or after the closing }.
4. Respond ONLY with raw, valid JSON matching the outputFormat exactly.
5. Write ACTUAL email body copy for every email — no placeholders, no "insert copy here".
6. Use Australian English spelling and tone throughout.
7. All copy must reflect the brand voice detected from the website crawl.

CRITICAL JSON RULES — failure to follow these causes a parse error:
- ALL string values must be on a single line. Use \n (backslash-n) for line breaks within strings — NEVER use actual newlines inside a JSON string value.
- ALL quotes inside string values must be escaped as \" — NEVER use unescaped double quotes inside a string.
- The flowDiagram field must be a single-line string with \n for line breaks.
- Keep bodyCopy under 200 words per email to stay within token limits.
- Design only 1 sequence (the most relevant) with a maximum of 5 emails.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES — CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
You MUST include "implementationChanges" with 3-5 complete email drafts.
- The "implementationChanges" MUST directly implement the specific "recommendations" you provide in your analysis. Each change should be the actual execution of a corresponding recommendation.
- For Email Sequence, these changes MUST consist of actual email drafts (subject line + body copy) or specific opt-in form rewrites that can be directly used by the business.
- "title" must be the name of the email (e.g., "Welcome Email 1", "Win-back Email").
- "location" must be the sequence or form where the change belongs (e.g., "Onboarding Sequence", "Exit Popup").
- "sourceUrl": exact source URL of the page where the change is located (taken from the crawl data) if applicable, or "Email Automation Platform".
- "actionType" must be one of: replace, insert_after, insert_before, create_page. Use create_page for entirely new sub-services or pages.
- "targetSelector" is an optional CSS selector or logical name of the section where the change applies.
- "proposedChange": COMPLETE email: subject line + preview text + full body copy + CTA text, ready to send. If you used an anchor in currentState to add new content, you MUST include the anchor text in proposedChange alongside the new content.
- "currentState" must quote EXACT existing content from the crawl data provided. **CRITICAL for Elementor**: Elementor stores text in small chunks. NEVER use multi-line strings or large paragraphs for 'currentState'. Pick a SHORT, single-line string (like a specific heading or a single sentence) that is unique on the page. If you are adding entirely new content, set this to the nearest single-line existing text to act as an anchor point.`,

INSTRUCTIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Choose the 2 most relevant sequence types for this business based on its industry, products/services, and lifecycle stage.
2. Design each sequence fully — complete email copy, subject lines, preview text, CTAs, timing, branching logic, and flow diagram.
3. Write ALL email body copy in full — no placeholders, no "insert copy here".
4. Use Australian English. Reflect the detected brand voice.
5. Include 2-3 A/B test recommendations.
6. Provide performance benchmarks for each sequence type.

REMEMBER: Start your response with { — NO markdown fences, NO preamble text.

Return your complete email sequence plan as raw JSON matching the outputFormat exactly.`;
